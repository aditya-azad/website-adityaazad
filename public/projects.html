This was my first stab at building a transpiler from scratch. It's pretty rudimentary but it works for generating static websites like this one.<h3><a href=https://github.com/aditya-azad/destined>Destined</a></h3><p>A glorified to-do application with various sorting and quick entry functionality. I built it a long time ago to help me organize my day quickly and somewhat automatically.<h3><a href=https://github.com/aditya-azad/candle-grey>Candle Grey</a></h3><p>A minimal, no-color color scheme designed for Vim8. It was built as an exercise in simplicity.</main><footer><p>Copyright 2024 Aditya Azad</footer>
