<h1>Hello! I'm Aditya ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<img id="cover" class="shadowed" src="/cover/0.webp" alt="A photo clicked by me" type="image/webp">
<p>I like to tinker with things, <em>especially software</em>. I like to take them apart and build them from scratch. I have worked on various software projects, some of which are accessible online. My portfolio mostly includes full-stack applications and open-source contributions, but I always follow my curiosity.</p>
<p>These days you can find me experimenting with machine learning projects, and working on my graduate degree.</p>
<p>Consider getting in touch.</p>
