<h3><a href="https://github.com/aditya-azad/simple-ssg">Simple Static Site Generator</a></h3>
<p>A static site generator built with Python that supports various file formats and file minification. This was my first stab at building a transpiler from scratch. It's pretty rudimentary but it works for generating static websites like this one.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/aditya-azad/destined">Destined</a></h3>
<p>A glorified to-do application with various sorting and quick entry functionality. I built it a long time ago to help me organize my day quickly and somewhat automatically.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/aditya-azad/candle-grey">Candle Grey</a></h3>
<p>A minimal, no-color color scheme designed for Vim8. It was built as an exercise in simplicity.</p>
