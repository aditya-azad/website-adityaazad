    <p>In my role as a machine learning engineer, I did some data annotation for the development of a facade defects detection and image generation project. I also experimented with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and image detection models. The objective was to generate synthetic facade images while also segmenting various types of defects. Our efforts, earned us 3rd Place Prize in the NYU Tandon Research Excellence Exhibit, 2024.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb">MindsDB</a></h3>
    <p>During Hacktoberfest 2023, I integrated nine APIs, including PyCaret, Pinecone, NPM, SAP ERP, Lightdash, Xata, Milvus, Apache Doris, and Shopify, into the MindsDB ecosystem. This experience broadened my technical proficiency and also provided me insights into the intricacies of API integration within a compressed time frame.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://crridom.gov.in/">CRRI</a></h3>
    <p>As a full-stack engineering contractor at the Central Road Research Institute of India, I developed web applications focused on processing raw data sets. These applications were designed to offer an intuitive user interface for data visualization and report generation. The projects also entailed significant geospatial data processing components.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.cummins.com/">Cummins</a></h3>
    <p>During my brief term as software engineer intern at Cummins, I wrote a service in Python using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. I also implemented a developer SDK in Java to be used within the company. Additionally, I won 3rd Place Prize in company wide intern hackathon with a group of coworkers.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383261088_Evaluating_GAN_Architectures_for_Generating_Images_of_Defective_Facades">Evaluating GAN Architectures for Generating Images of Defective Facades</a></h3>
    <p>We evaluated the performance of DCGAN, BigGAN, and Lightweight GAN architectures in generating facade images featuring four types of defects: erosion, efflorescence, missing mortar, and spalling. Our primary goal was to generate additional data to augment existing datasets. Among the models tested, Lightweight GAN proved to be particularly effective for this application.</p>

<h1>Projects ‚ú®</h1>

<div class="card">
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/aditya-azad/simple-ssg">Simple Static Site Generator</a></h3>
    <p>A static site generator built with Python that supports various file formats and file minification. This was my first stab at building a transpiler from scratch. It's pretty rudimentary but it works for generating static websites like this one.</p>
